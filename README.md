# Fullstack-hello

Fullstack hello demo using the [craft beers
dataset](https://github.com/nickhould/craft-beers-dataset).

## Development

### Dev Dependencies

This project uses the [just command runner](https://github.com/casey/just) to
run project specific commands. See the excellent upstream docs on how to
install *just*.

Run `just -l` to get an overview of available commands.

Nix users can just use the `./just` wrapper and not worry about dependencies.
